# TE-Project
Idea behind this project is that placement process is very tedious, company
recruiters and teachers work so hard to finally select best students for a
particular company, many students leave their job in one or two year in
most of cases they are not able to cope up with companyâ€™s environment so
in this project we detect emotions of employees at work place using face 
expressions and generate a report for HR to analyze that which
employees are not in good mood most of time while working, HR can
consult them, Help them which will ultimately motivate employees to do
quality work.
